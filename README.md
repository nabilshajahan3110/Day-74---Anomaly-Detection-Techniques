## Day-74---Anomaly-Detection-Techniques
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python covers anomaly detection techniques.

Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual patterns, outliers, or anomalies in a dataset that do not conform to expected behavior. Python offers several libraries and techniques for anomaly detection. Below are the key methods and techniques commonly used:

### 1. Statistical Methods

**Z-Score or Standard Score:** Measures the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.  Use scipy.stats.zscore.

**IQR (Interquartile Range):** Detects outliers by identifying data points outside 1.5 times the IQR range.

### 2. Machine Learning Methods

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Identifies anomalies by finding points far from their nearest neighbors. Use sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.

**Isolation Forest:** Uses random trees to isolate anomalies. Use sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.

### 3. Deep Learning Methods

**Autoencoders:** Neural networks that learn compressed representations of data. Anomalies are points with high reconstruction error.

### 4. Clustering Methods

**DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Identifies dense clusters, marking low-density regions as anomalies. Use sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.

**K-Means:** Points far from cluster centroids are treated as anomalies.

### 5. Time-Series Anomaly Detection

**ARIMA/Seasonal Decomposition:** Models seasonal trends, identifying anomalies as deviations from the expected trend. Use statsmodels.tsa.

**Prophet:** Models time-series data and identifies anomalies based on residuals. Use prophet.

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Deep learning model for sequential anomaly detection.

### 6. Specialized Libraries

**PyOD (Python Outlier Detection):** Comprehensive library for anomaly detection with many algorithms.

**Scikit-learn:** General-purpose machine learning library that supports various anomaly detection techniques.
